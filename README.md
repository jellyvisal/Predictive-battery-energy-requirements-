Designing an energy-efficient and thermally optimized battery pack is crucial for various applications, from electric vehicles to renewable energy storage systems.
The energy requirements for a battery pack and the associated cooling requirements are closely interconnected, as both factors impact the overall performance, 
safety, and longevity of the system.

Energy Requirements for Battery Pack:

The energy requirements of a battery pack depend on the intended application and the desired operational parameters. Here are the key factors that 
determine the energy requirements:

The Excel sheet called "Tataace1.5Ton" contains the vehicle dynamics calculations and heat generated in the battery pack during the drive cycle. 

THe Drive cycle chosen for the experiment is WLTP Class 1 
WLTP is an international driving cycle standard and is know for its rugged nature and extreme simulation conditions. 
Here are the key reasons why the WLTP drive cycle is considered harsher:

Realistic Driving Conditions: The WLTP drive cycle incorporates a broader range of driving scenarios that are more representative of real-world driving conditions. This includes a mix of urban, suburban, and highway driving, as well as variations in speed, acceleration, and deceleration. The NEDC, on the other hand, had a more limited set of driving conditions that did not accurately capture the complexities of actual driving patterns.

Higher Average Speeds: The WLTP drive cycle includes higher average speeds compared to the NEDC. This is significant because higher speeds typically lead to increased aerodynamic drag and greater energy consumption. The faster driving segments in the WLTP cycle reflect highway driving, where vehicles tend to consume more fuel due to the higher energy requirements at higher speeds.

Aggressive Acceleration and Deceleration: The WLTP drive cycle includes more aggressive acceleration and deceleration events, which better simulate real-world driving behaviors. Rapid acceleration and deceleration have a direct impact on fuel consumption and emissions, and including these events in the test cycle provides a more accurate representation of how vehicles perform in everyday situations.

Longer Test Duration: The WLTP drive cycle has a longer overall test duration compared to the NEDC. This longer test time allows the engine and vehicle systems to reach stable operating conditions, leading to more accurate measurements of fuel consumption and emissions.

Inclusion of Additional Factors: The WLTP drive cycle takes into account factors such as vehicle mass, aerodynamic drag, and rolling resistance. These factors contribute to the overall energy requirements of the vehicle and are considered in the calculation of fuel consumption and emissions.

Dynamic Load Variations: The WLTP drive cycle considers variations in vehicle load, including the number of occupants and cargo. This accounts for the impact of added weight on fuel efficiency and emissions, which is particularly important for real-world scenarios where vehicles are often used with varying load levels.
